Epic Title:
Non‑Production Network Security Hardware Decommissioning & Audit Remediation
Epic Description:
"This epic covers the identification, decommissioning, and removal of
legacy, end‑of‑life (EOL), or unsupported network security hardware from
non‑production environments. During PCI and FTC audits, multiple EOL and
still-active devices were discovered, creating operational complexity
and generating audit scrutiny when selected for evidence review. To
resolve these issues, the team conducted an asset management search and
identified several legacy platforms requiring retirement, including:

- Fortinet IDS Sensors
- Arista NDR Platform
- Legacy FireMon Appliances (ops)
- Legacy FireEye Appliances
- EOL SourceFire IDS Appliances

This epic ensures all legacy systems are systematically removed from
physical environments, logical configurations, and inventory systems to
reduce technical debt and eliminate audit complications."

Business Outcome:
"Streamlined audit reviews by eliminating unsupported and unmanaged security devices from inventory.
Reduced technical debt across InfoSec, Network Engineering, and Operational areas.
Improved accuracy of CMDB and asset tracking, enabling better lifecycle management.
Reduced operational complexity by removing unused or redundant platforms.
Improved security posture by eliminating unmanaged or unmonitored attack surface."
Problem Statement (Optional):
During recent PCI and FTC audit cycles, auditors identified several EOL
or unsupported network security platforms still active or inventoried in
non‑production. These devices created difficulties during evidence
review because they no longer had owners, lifecycle documentation,
patching records, or active maintenance support. Their presence
contributed to audit findings and unnecessary escalations. A
comprehensive asset management review confirmed that these platforms are
unused and should be fully decommissioned.
Scope:
This epic includes the physical and logical decommissioning of the
following platforms in non‑production environments:

- Fortinet IDS Sensors
- Arista NDR Platform
- Legacy FireMon appliances
- Legacy FireEye appliances
- EOL SourceFire IDS Appliances

Scope includes:

- Inventory and asset validation
- Removal from DNS
- Removal from monitoring (SolarWinds, NOC tools)
- CMDB updates
- Physical and/or virtual removal
- Documentation and audit evidence capture
- Change management approvals and tracking
Out of Scope (Optional):
"- Production environment assets (unless discovered as incorrectly categorized)
- Replacement technology selection or architecture redesign
- SOC workflow updates unrelated to device removal
- Vendor contract termination management (handled separately)"
Success Metrics / KPIs:
"- 100% of identified legacy devices removed from non‑production environments
- 100% CMDB and asset records updated to “Retired/Removed”
- 100% DNS and monitoring entries removed
- Zero audit findings tied to legacy devices in next PCI/FTC cycle
- Reduction in non‑production security asset count by X% (determined after inventory)"
Assumptions:
"- No business processes rely on the legacy platforms
- All required access (SNOW, CMDB, DNS, SolarWinds) is available
- Network Engineering, InfoSec, and Asset teams provide required support
- Audit team accepts standard evidence package created by the project"
Dependencies:
"- Change management approval windows
- Rack access or remote/virtual decommissioning capability
- CMDB ownership approvals
- Monitoring team availability for system updates
- DNS team availability for record removal"
High‑Level Deliverables:
"- Validated asset inventory for all legacy device platforms
- Decommission plan and CHG request
- Device removal tickets (one per device)
- Removal of DNS, monitoring, and logical references
- Updated CMDB/asset records
- Audit‑ready evidence package
- Final project closure summary delivered to Audit and Compliance"
