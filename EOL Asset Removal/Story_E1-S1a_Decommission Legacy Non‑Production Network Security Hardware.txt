User Story Title:
Decommission Legacy Non‑Production Network Security Hardware
User Story Desctiption:
Remove legacy, unused, or end‑of‑life network security hardware from non‑production environments and associated inventory systems to reduce technical debt and eliminate recurring audit findings caused by dormant assets remaining in CMDB and asset lists.
Creator:
Project Manager
Status:
In Progress
Owner:
Arthur Andersons
Business Outcome:
Eliminates recurring audit inquiries and evidence gaps tied to inactive
hardware still present in inventory. Improves organizational security
posture by removing unmanaged assets. Reduces technical debt from
maintaining obsolete or unsupported systems. Enhances accuracy of CMDB,
asset management, and lifecycle reporting. Saves cost and operational
time associated with maintaining unused equipment.
Problem Statement (Optional):
"Audit teams routinely flag legacy non‑production network security
appliances still listed in asset inventories. These devices are no
longer functional or required, making it impossible to provide audit
evidence (e.g., configuration, patch level, segmentation, ownership).
This results in unnecessary findings and escalations. Formal
decommissioning resolves these evidence gaps and aligns with long‑term
technical debt reduction initiatives."
Acceptance Criteria:
"Given:

Legacy non‑production network security hardware is present in CMDB,
asset lists, or physically installed

When:

The device is verified as unused, unsupported, or no longer required for
business or testing functions

Then:

The hardware is physically removed from racks and disconnected from
network and power Logical references (IPs, firewall rules, VLANs,
monitoring agents, DNS entries, routing objects) are removed CMDB and
asset management records are updated to reflect decommissioning The
device is removed from vulnerability scanning and lifecycle tools A
decommission record is created with sufficient audit evidence
Appropriate change management approvals are documented"
Definition of Done:
"- Approved CHG request for decommissioning
- Hardware removed from physical environment
- Logical artifacts removed across network, security, and monitoring systems
- CMDB/asset records updated and validated removed
- Audit evidence package created (before/after photos, config wipe
  confirmation, CMDB update ticket, CHG ticket) 
- Stakeholder notification"
