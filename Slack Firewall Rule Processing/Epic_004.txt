Epic Title: Implement automated Slack alerting and in‑Slack decisioning for Tufin firewall rule requests, including analysis, approve/deny, and optional user email.
Status: 

Epic Description:
Notifying analysts in Slack when a rule-add request needs review,
Reformatting and streaming request context into Splunk for analysis,
Enabling in‑Slack actions to capture clarifications and make decisions
(Approve / Deny / Request Info), and Sending optional user email from
Slack to accelerate remediation and reduce cycle time. The solution will
reduce manual login/filtering in SecureChange, lower manual review
percentage through automation of common patterns, and shorten review
time using targeted alerting.

Business Outcome:
- Reduce manual review percentage from 79.5% to <50%.
- Reduce median time-to-first-touch and time-to-decision for flagged requests by ≥30%.
- Improve auditability and consistency of rule A3decisions through structured data capture and Splunk analytics.

Problem Statement (Optional):
- Context: Manual review of “insecure” rule requests requires analysts to log into SecureChange and filter for review tickets.

Scope:
- Slack App (Bot) for alerts, interactive reviews, and email send trigger.
- Eventing from Tufin SecureChange to Slack via backend service.

Out of Scope (Optional):
- Core policy computation changes in SecureTrack/optimizer beyond API consumption.
- Bulk historical backfill of past tickets (unless explicitly added).
- End-user submissions interface changes (beyond email from Slack to requester).
- SSO lifecycle or Slack workspace governance beyond app installation and scopes.

Success Metrics / KPIs:
% of requests requiring manual review → <50% within 2 quarters.

Median time-to-first-analyst-touch for flagged requests → -30%.

Median time-to-decision for flagged requests → -30%.

% of “common” patterns handled automatically → ≥25% by phase 2.

Slack action adoption (unique analysts interacting weekly) → ≥80% of analyst team.

Assumptions:
Tufin SecureChange exposes APIs/webhooks (or polling) to retrieve
relevant ticket data and post decisions. Slack Enterprise Grid or
Workspace permits custom app with interactive components. Splunk HEC
(HTTP Event Collector) is available with appropriate index and
sourcetype. Email can be sent via Microsoft Graph (app reg) or SMTP
relay with service principal or technical account. Firewall governance
RACI remains unchanged; this is tooling enablement.

Dependencies:
Tufin SecureChange API credentials and environment access.

Slack App registration, OAuth scopes, signing secret, and approval by Slack admins.

Splunk HEC token, index, and network ACLs.

Identity / RBAC mapping for Slack users ↔ SecureChange analysts.

Email channel (Graph or SMTP) service account and app registration.

Secrets management (e.g., Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) and CI/C

High‑Level Deliverables:
Slack App with Block Kit alerts and interactive decision forms.

Backend service (microservice/lambda) integrating Tufin ↔ Slack ↔ Splunk ↔ Email.

Splunk data model & dashboards for review support and telemetry.

Automation rule engine for “common” requests (phase 2).

Audit logs & evidence artifacts (Splunk) for SOX/ISO controls.

Runbooks and support docs.

Child User Stories:
S1: Slack alert on new/flagged SecureChange request.

Risks & Mitigations:
- 	Risk: Slack outages or message delivery delays.
	Mitigation: Retry + dead-letter queue; parallel email fallback; status dashboard.
-	Risk: Incorrect approvals via Slack by unauthorized users.
	Mitigation: RBAC check (Slack user ↔ analyst role) + secondary confirmation for high-risk changes.
-	Risk: Payload PII/PHI in Splunk.
	Mitigation: Field-level filtering/redaction; encryption in transit; index access controls.
-	Risk: API rate limits (Tufin/Slack/Graph).
	Mitigation: Backoff, batching, idempotent design.
-	Risk: Automation false positives/negatives.
	Mitigation: Start in shadow mode, measure drift, gradual rollout with kill-switch.

Stakeholders / Roles (Optional):
Product Owner (Firewall Governance), SecEng Team, SOC (FYI), Network Ops, IT Messaging (Graph/SMTP), Slack Admins, Audit/Compliance.

Approvals Needed (Optional):
Slack app approval, Tufin API access approval, Splunk index creation, Email app registration/security review.

Definition of Done:
All user stories accepted in prod.

KPIs instrumented and observable in Splunk dashboards.

Runbooks (L1/L2), on-call alerts, and support handoff complete.

Security review complete (threat model, secrets, logging).

DR plan & rollback playbooks validated in lower env.

Notes / Additional Context:
Phase 2 automation can extend to programmatic policy checks and exceptions governance.
