User Story Title:
Automate common rule requests with Slack transparency

User Story Description:
As a firewall rule analyst, I want common requests to be auto-evaluated and, when safe, auto-approved with Slack transparency to minimize manual review and TTC.

Owner:
SecEng – Policy Automation

Business Outcome:
Reduce manual review volume and cycle time; increase consistency.

Problem Statement (Optional):
High volume of predictable requests consumes scarce analyst bandwidth.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Define automation rules for common patterns (e.g., known app ports, intra‑zone, low risk, existing precedent).
2. Rules run deterministically with explainability text; decisions logged.
3. Auto-approved/auto-denied tickets posted to Slack as informational with override option (grace period).
4. Shadow mode available to measure impact before enabling enforcement.
5. KPI tracking split: manual vs automated; false‑positive/negative metrics.

Definition of Done:
- Rules engine live; shadow → enforce rollout documented; KPIs in Splunk.

Notes / Additional Context:
Start with a narrow rule set and expand based on evidence.

Associated with Epic:
