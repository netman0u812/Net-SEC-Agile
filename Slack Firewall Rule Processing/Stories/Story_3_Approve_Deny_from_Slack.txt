User Story Title:

User Story Description:
As a firewall rule analyst, I want to approve/deny from Slack to progress implementation efficiently.

Creator:

Status:
Proposed → In Progress → Done

Owner:
SecEng – Integrations

Business Outcome:
Shorter time-to-decision; improved throughput.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Decisioning requires navigating SecureChange UI and slows throughput.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Modal offers “Approve”, “Deny”, and “Request Info” (moves to Story 4 UX if email needed).
2. Approvals/denials posted to SecureChange via API with required comments/reason codes.
3. High‑risk changes require a secondary confirmation step or 2nd approver (configurable).
4. Decision result updates the Slack thread and logs to Splunk with full audit trail.
5. Idempotent: duplicate clicks don’t create duplicate transitions.

Definition of Done:
- Decision actions fully operational UAT→Prod.
- Negative tests for unauthorized actions pass.

Notes / Additional Context:
Include ephemeral error messages for failure paths and guidance for remediation.
