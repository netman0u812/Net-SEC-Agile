User Story Title:
Slack alert for new/flagged SecureChange requests

User Story Description:
As a firewall rule analyst, I want to receive a Slack message when a request is submitted/flagged for review so I can be aware without logging into SecureChange.

Business Outcome:
Reduce time-to-first-touch and missed tickets.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Analysts lose time polling SecureChange and filtering queues.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Slack Bot posts to the designated channel/thread within ≤60 seconds of event ingestion.
2. Message includes: Ticket ID, Requester, Source/Destination, Ports/Protocols, Justification, Risk flags, Links.
3. Only analysts (RBAC) can see sensitive details (use channel membership or DM with channel summary).
4. All alerts logged to Splunk with correlation ID.
5. Failures retried 3x with exponential backoff; dead-letter queue logged.

Definition of Done:
- Alerts visible in Slack UAT and Prod.
- E2E event observed in Splunk with correct fields.
- Security review of scopes and data sanitization complete.

Notes / Additional Context:
Support both new tickets and state transitions (e.g., “Needs Review”).
