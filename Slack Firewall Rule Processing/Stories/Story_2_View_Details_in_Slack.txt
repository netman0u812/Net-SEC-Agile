Business Outcome:
Reduce friction and switching costs; faster and more consistent decisions.

Problem Statement (Optional):
Analysts must context switch to multiple tools to gather needed information.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Slack message includes an “Expand details” button opening a modal with full context: flows, source/dest objects, service groups, justification, change history snapshot, risk signals, related assets/owners (if available).
2. PII/PHI redacted per policy.
3. Modal includes link-outs to SecureChange and Splunk ticket view.
4. Modal loads ≤2s with cached/async enrichment (asset owner, CMDB).
5. Access control: only authorized analysts can open sensitive modals.

Definition of Done:
- Modal implemented and security-tested.
- Telemetry to Splunk logs open/close events and fields viewed.

Notes / Additional Context:
Design for dark/light mode, and mobile Slack compatibility when practical.
