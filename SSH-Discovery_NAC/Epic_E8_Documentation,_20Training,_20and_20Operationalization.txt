Epic Title:
Documentation, Training, and Operationalization

Epic Description:
Create full documentation, runbooks, training programs, and operational workflows required for long-term NAC sustainability.

Creator: Martin, Michael J
Status: Draft / Proposed
Owner: Network Security Engineering

Business Outcome:
Enable support teams, engineers, and operations to confidently manage, troubleshoot, and evolve the NAC ecosystem.

Problem Statement:
NAC spans multiple teams and technologies; without structured documentation and training, operations will be inconsistent.

Scope:
- Produce end-to-end architecture documentation
- Create runbooks for troubleshooting, onboarding, outages, and exceptions
- Deliver staff training for support, engineering, and operations
- Define operational workflows and escalation models

Out of Scope:
- Long-term knowledge management platform selection
- Vendor certification programs

Success Metrics / KPIs:
- 100% runbooks completed and reviewed
- All ops staff trained and certified internally
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR) reduced by ≥ 30%

Assumptions:
- SMEs available for documentation validation
- Training windows approved by management

Dependencies:
- All technical Epics (E1–E7)

High-Level Deliverables:
1. NAC Architecture Document
2. Runbook Library
3. Training Curriculum + Materials
4. Operational Workflows & Escalation Pathways
5. Knowledge Base (KB) Articles

Child User Stories:
- As support teams, we need runbooks.
- As architects, we need complete documentation.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Outdated documents → Version control + ownership assignments.
- Training gaps → Recurring quarterly refresh.

Definition of Done:
- All documentation produced, validated, and published
- Staff trained and signed off
- KB integrated into daily operations

Notes:
This Epic enables the NAC program to transition from project to steady-state operations.
