Epic Title:
IPAM, CMDB, and SIEM Enrichment

Epic Description:
Integrate NAC discovery, classification, and enforcement outputs into IPAM, CMDB, and SIEM systems to ensure accurate inventories, enriched security telemetry, and complete lifecycle visibility.

Creator: Martin, Michael J
Status: Draft / Proposed
Owner: Network Security Engineering

Business Outcome:
Achieve unified, authoritative device inventory and enhanced SIEM visibility, enabling better incident response, compliance reporting, and asset governance.

Problem Statement:
IPAM/CMDB systems often contain stale or incomplete records. NAC provides ground-truth identity and activity data that must be fed into these systems for accurate enterprise visibility.

Scope:
- Integrate device-type classification outputs with IPAM and CMDB
- Provide enriched metadata (MAC, IP, VLAN, device_type, confidence, posture) to SIEM
- Automate updates to reduce manual reconciliation
- Establish data contracts and refresh intervals

Out of Scope:
- Full CMDB redesign
- SIEM correlation rule authoring beyond enrichment inputs

Success Metrics / KPIs:
- ≥ 95% match rate between NAC inventory and IPAM/CMDB
- ≥ 90% of NAC events enriched in SIEM within ≤ 60 seconds
- Significant reduction in stale CMDB entries

Assumptions:
- APIs or ingestion methods exist for all target systems
- NAC enrichment engine is stable and producing outputs

Dependencies:
- Device-Type Classification (Epic E2)
- Enforcement and Policy Epics

High-Level Deliverables:
1. IPAM/CMDB Mapping Engine
2. SIEM Enrichment Pipeline
3. Data Quality Dashboards
4. Data Contracts & Schemas
5. Reconciliation Automation

Child User Stories:
- As IPAM/CMDB owners, we need accurate device inventories.
- As SIEM, I need enriched metadata for NAC events.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Data inconsistencies → Implement reconciliation job + alerts.
- API limits → batch updates + rate-control.

Definition of Done:
- IPAM/CMDB updates automated and validated
- SIEM enrichment active with validated fields
- Dashboards and data contracts published

Notes:
This Epic ensures enterprise systems share a single source of truth.
