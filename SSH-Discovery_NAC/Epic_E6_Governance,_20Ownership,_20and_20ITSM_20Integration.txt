Epic Title:
Governance, Ownership, and ITSM Integration

Epic Description:
Define governance, roles, RACI, and ITSM workflows for NAC operations. Integrate NAC with ticketing, monitoring, compliance, and change‑management systems.

Creator: Martin, Michael J
Status: Draft / Proposed
Owner: Network Security Engineering

Business Outcome:
A durable operational model with clear ownership, minimized confusion, and automated ticketing and compliance alignment.

Problem Statement:
NAC touches multiple teams (Network, Security, SOC, ITSM). Without a governance model, operational gaps lead to outages and untracked exceptions.

Scope:
- Develop NAC RACI model
- Define ownership for policy, enforcement, exceptions, break‑glass, and outages
- Integrate NAC logs + events with ITSM for auto‑ticketing
- Map NAC processes to compliance requirements

Out of Scope:
- SOC tooling redesign
- CMDB redesign

Success Metrics / KPIs:
- ≥ 90% NAC events auto‑ticketed within 60 seconds
- Clear RACI adoption across all teams
- Compliance reporting automated for NAC‑related controls

Assumptions:
- ITSM platform supports automated event ingestion
- All teams agree to documented governance

Dependencies:
- Policy Framework (E3)
- Enforcement + Rollout Epics

High‑Level Deliverables:
1. NAC RACI Model
2. Governance Charter
3. ITSM Auto‑Ticketing Integration
4. Compliance Mapping
5. Runbook + Escalation Workflows

Child User Stories:
- As ITSM, I need auto‑ticket creation for NAC events.
- As GRC, I need compliance alignment.

Risks & Mitigations:
- ITSM ingestion issues → API monitoring and retry pipelines.
- Team ownership conflicts → Steering committee arbitration.

Definition of Done:
- Governance charter signed
- ITSM workflows live
- RACI adopted across all teams

Notes:
This Epic establishes the long‑term operational guardrails for NAC.
