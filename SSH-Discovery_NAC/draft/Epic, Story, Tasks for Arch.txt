    Implement alerts for rogue/unknown spikes

📘 EPIC 4 — Enforcement Pipeline (RADIUS + dACL + CoA)
User Stories

So MAB events are authenticated and authorized.

Tasks

    Configure switch AAA/RADIUS settings
    Validate MAB request formatting
    Configure dACLs in Forescout
    Ensure RADIUS response attributes match vendor syntax
    Validate CoA behavior on posture changes

Story 4.2 — As Security, I need reusable ACL templates

So segmentation is consistent across sites.

Tasks

    Create ACL templates per device type
    Standardize naming conventions
    Maintain ACL library in repo
    Build ACL test harness against lab switches

📘 EPIC 5 — Staging → Pilot → Production Rollout
User Stories
Story 5.1 — As a program lead, I need a phased enforcement model

So the rollout is safe with low user impact.

Tasks

    Phase 0: Monitor‑only
    Phase 1: Managed endpoint enforcement
    Phase 2: IoT/OT enforcement
    Phase 3: Unknown quarantine
