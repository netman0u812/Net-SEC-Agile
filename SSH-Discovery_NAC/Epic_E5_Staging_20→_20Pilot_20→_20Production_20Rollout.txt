Epic Title:
Staging → Pilot → Production Rollout

Epic Description:
Define and execute a phased NAC rollout model that moves from controlled staging → pilot sites → full global production. Provide validation workflows, dashboards, and site‑specific cutover playbooks.

Creator: Martin, Michael J
Status: Draft / Proposed
Owner: Network Security Engineering

Business Outcome:
Enable safe NAC adoption through structured rollout stages that minimize operational disruption.

Problem Statement:
NAC enforcement cannot be deployed globally without controlled testing, pilot validation, and strict governance.

Scope:
- Build a staging environment mirroring production
- Create pilot selection criteria
- Site‑by‑site playbooks
- Health validation dashboards
- Rollback and fail‑safe procedures

Out of Scope:
- Long‑term product support SLAs
- Legacy site modernization unrelated to NAC

Success Metrics / KPIs:
- ≥ 95% success on pilot validation tests
- < 1% incidents attributable to NAC after production rollout
- Site rollout time reduced by 50% between early and late phases

Assumptions:
- Staging environment has similar hardware and configurations
- Pilot sites represent a statistically meaningful cross‑section

Dependencies:
- Enforcement Pipeline (Epic E4)
- Policy Framework (Epic E3)

High‑Level Deliverables:
1. Staging Lab Architecture
2. Cutover Playbooks
3. Validation Dashboards
4. Rollout Runbooks
5. Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) Framework

Child User Stories:
- As Ops, I need validation dashboards.
- As a site lead, I need site‑by‑site rollout workflows.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Uneven site readiness → Pre‑flight readiness checks.
- Rollout regressions → Automated test harness + rollback steps.

Definition of Done:
- Staging, pilot, and production phases complete
- All sites meeting steady‑state NAC KPIs
- Rollout retrospectives completed

Notes:
This Epic ensures predictable, safe scaling of NAC enforcement.
